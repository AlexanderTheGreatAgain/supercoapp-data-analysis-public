Use `~.Axes.pcolor` if you need this functionality.\n"," |      \n"," |      .. _axes-pcolormesh-grid-orientation:\n"," |      \n"," |      **Grid orientation**\n"," |      \n"," |      The grid orientation follows the standard matrix convention: An array\n"," |      *C* with shape (nrows, ncolumns) is plotted with the column number as\n"," |      *X* and the row number as *Y*.\n"," |      \n"," |      .. _differences-pcolor-pcolormesh:\n"," |      \n"," |      **Differences between pcolor() and pcolormesh()**\n"," |      \n"," |      Both methods are used to create a pseudocolor plot of a 2-D array\n"," |      using quadrilaterals.\n"," |      \n"," |      The main difference lies in the created object and internal data\n"," |      handling:\n"," |      While `~.Axes.pcolor` returns a `.PolyCollection`, `~.Axes.pcolormesh`\n"," |      returns a `.QuadMesh`. The latter is more specialized for the given\n"," |      purpose and thus is faster. It should almost always be preferred.\n"," |      \n"," |      There is also a slight difference in the handling of masked arrays.\n"," |      Both `~.Axes.pcolor` and `~.Axes.pcolormesh` support masked arrays\n"," |      for *C*. However, only `~.Axes.pcolor` supports masked arrays for *X*\n"," |      and *Y*. The reason lies in the internal handling of the masked values.\n"," |      `~.Axes.pcolor` leaves out the respective polygons from the\n"," |      PolyCollection. `~.Axes.pcolormesh` sets the facecolor of the masked\n"," |      elements to transparent. You can see the difference when using\n"," |      edgecolors. While all edges are drawn irrespective of masking in a\n"," |      QuadMesh, the edge between two adjacent masked quadrilaterals in\n"," |      `~.Axes.pcolor` is not drawn as the corresponding polygons do not\n"," |      exist in the PolyCollection.\n"," |      \n"," |      Another difference is the support of Gouraud shading in\n"," |      `~.Axes.pcolormesh`, which is not available with `~.Axes.pcolor`.\n"," |      \n"," |      .. note::\n"," |          In addition to the above described arguments, this function can take a\n"," |          **data** keyword argument.
